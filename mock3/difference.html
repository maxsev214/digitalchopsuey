							<p>1. Proven Expertise

								Our founder, Lezly Kaye, brings over 15 years of recruitment and business leadership experience. Having built multiple 7- and 8-figure organizations, she knows exactly what businesses need to succeed. Lezly has developed a proven success matrix that delivers exceptional results at a fraction of the cost, providing solutions from high-performance recruitment to strategic business scaling.
								Additionally, Siobhon Davis, our Partner and Real Estate Specialist, brings extensive real estate expertise, having managed prestigious portfolios and trained VAs to excel in real estate support. Together, Lezly and Siobhon ensure that we have the in-depth knowledge and systems in place to support multiple industries.

								2. Humanitarian Focus

								At The OE, we believe in ethical outsourcing that not only benefits our clients but also uplifts our global team. We are committed to paying 20-40% above local wages in the regions we operate, particularly in the Philippines, ensuring that our team members are well-compensated, motivated, and empowered to deliver exceptional service. Our long-term vision is to create a sustainable work ecosystem that improves the lives of our employees, and we are actively working toward BCorp certification, reinforcing our commitment to ethical business practices.

								3. Real-World, Lived Experience

								We know what it takes because we've lived it. Our leadership team has hands-on experience in founding and scaling successful businesses, from solo-preneurs looking for efficient processes to large corporations needing to scale at speed. We understand the importance of reducing stress, streamlining operations, and building systems that support long-term growth. With The OE, you’re not just getting an outsourcing service—you’re getting a team of experts who have built successful businesses from the ground up.
