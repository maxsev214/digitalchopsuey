									<h3>Cost Savings Compared to In-House Admin</h3>
									<p>One of the biggest advantages of hiring a Real Estate Virtual Assistant (VA) from The OE is the significant cost savings compared to employing in-house admin staff in Australia. With rising wages and increased overheads, outsourcing your administrative and marketing tasks to our skilled VAs can save your real estate business up to 60% on annual wages.</p>
